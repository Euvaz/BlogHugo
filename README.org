BlogHugo is my automated blog website powered by [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]], a popular static site generator. This repository provides a robust setup for building and deploying a Hugo-based blog using GitHub Actions and a custom Dockerfile, thereby utilizing [[https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really][GitOps]] methodologies. It streamlines the process of managing my blog, automating the build and test process, and ensuring my content stays up-to-date.
